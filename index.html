	<p>I am a student majoring in Computer Science and Statistics at Luther College, Decorah, IA. I am really interested in Data Science, Data Analysis, Software and Hardware Development</p>
	<p>Some of the reasons why I am a competitive candidate for your positions are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><p>I am an active and fast learner. I learn new knowledge and skills that the job require. I have done self-study for actuary tests and some programming languages such as Java, C, PHP, etc</p></li>
		<li><p>I have a good ability to focus. I can focus for a long time to finish assigned tasks.</p></li>
		<li><p>Two of my biggest strengths are restoretive and analytics. Studying Maths and Computer Science has helped me consolidate and empowered these skills. I also have chances to use and improve these skills constantly with my work-study and my student-organization as a leader.</p></li>
		<li><p>Responsibility and good working ethics are work that people use to describe me. For me, being responsible with what I have committed to is one of the most important rules that I set for myself.</p></li>
		<li><p>Last but not least, I am a smiley face. I smile all the time because I believe that seeing someone smile will help you have a better day. I volunteer to be that 'someone'</p></li>
