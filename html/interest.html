			<h1>My interests!</h1>
			<p>My biggest interest is singing. I am a member of choir because I love singing too  much and I literally sing whenever I want and whenever I can. Singing helps me destress and gives me a positive attitude towards things</p>
			
			<p>Another hobbie that I have is cooking. I love cooking, especially baking. I usually cook a lot of Vietnamese dishes and sometime try out with some basic American dishes. My favorite disk to make is stir-fry beef vegetable and noodles.<br> I have not baked a lot because people do not bake in Vietnam but I am trying to bake more because I really enjoy creating sweet dessert.</p>
			
			<p>The last hobby I want to share is volunteering. I really like to do volunteer work since it is a way for me to give back to the community. I have helped out with various of volunteering activities, such as catering for free meals, helping out Sunday School, doing mentor for a day, and ect</p>
